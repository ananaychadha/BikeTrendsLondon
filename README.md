# BikeTrendsLondon

## Objective
This project explores patterns in Londonâ€™s bike ride data to uncover insights related to ride frequency, seasonal variations, and the influence of weather conditions. Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset provides a wealth of information that allows for detailed data cleaning, visualisation, and storytelling, demonstrating my capabilities as a data analyst.

## Dataset
The dataset, `london_merged.csv`, contains comprehensive records of bike rides in London. It includes various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, and timestamps, enabling an in-depth analysis of ride trends.

You can find the complete code and dataset in my GitHub repository.

### Crafting Dynamic Visualizations with Tableau 
With the cleaned dataset, I created several insightful visualisations using Tableau:

1. **Moving Average (Line)**: Showcases the timeline of bike rides.
2. **Total Rides (Text)**: Displays the total count of bike rides for the selected period.
3. **Temperature vs Wind Speed (Heatmap)**: Explores the relationship between temperature and wind speed.
4. **Weather (Bar)**: Illustrates the distribution of weather conditions.
5. **Hour (Bar)**: Displays bike rides throughout a 24-hour cycle.
6. **Full Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard that allows viewers to explore data across different periods.

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook `RunningCore.ipynb` to follow the project and see results.

## Results
The project reports on:

- Insights from the visualisations and analysis conducted on the dataset.
- Key trends and patterns observed during the analysis process.
